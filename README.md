# rename-it-later

## Important Note

This was a proof of concept app. [Barry](https://github.com/brrygrdn) wrote most of this however it wasn't meant to be as the idea was scratching an itch that most developers have.
However at [Skillfulgorilla](http://skillfulgorilla.com) we believe that sometimes it is about putting your hand up and walking up to the chalkboard and seeing what happens.
